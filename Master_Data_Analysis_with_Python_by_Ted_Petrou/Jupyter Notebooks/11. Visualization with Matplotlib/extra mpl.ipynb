    "1. There are two interfaces - object-oriented and pyplot\n",
    "2. The documentation is thorough but scattered, with no single, simple, straightforward approach to getting started\n",
    "3. The `plot` method is very convoluted with so many possible positional arguments. It's also misnamed - it's primary purpose is to create line plots. The other data plotting methods are much more explicit\n",
    "4. The hierarchy between the figure and axes\n",
    "5. The word 'axes' - it is not related to the x or y axis. It is the actual 'plot'. I pronounce it 'Axeez' when teaching to differentiate it from 'axis'\n",
    "6. It's difficult to find the possible values for the extra keyword arguments - linestyle, marker, hatch\n",
