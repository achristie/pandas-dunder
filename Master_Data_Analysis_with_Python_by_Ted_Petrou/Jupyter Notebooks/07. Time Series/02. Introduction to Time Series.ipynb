    "Examples of time series data include stock market closing prices, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, unemployment rates, etc... pandas has good functionality with regards to manipulating dates, aggregating over different time periods, sampling different periods of time, and more. Let's begin by reading in 20 years of stock market data, putting the 'date' column in the index."
